    "section": "",
    "text": "NCAA volleyball is back and is in the midst of a very competitive season. Conference play is in full swing, and teams are starting to tentatively look ahead to the postseason. As they do that, I want to look back at last season’s statistics to hopefully uncover what makes an All-American at (in my opinion) the most important position in volleyball: the setter. Setters run the offense and are often the “on-the-court coach” on most teams. In many cases, a great setter also leads to a great team. In 2024, all ten All-American setters were on teams ranked in the top six in their NCAA tournament regions. Obviously, teams want to recruit elite setters to bring their team to the next level, but that begs the question: What makes an All-American setter?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(GGally)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nvb &lt;- read_csv(\"data/ncaa_womens_volleyball_playerstats_2024.csv\")\n\n#head(vb)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nvb &lt;- vb %&gt;%\n  group_by(team) %&gt;%\n  rename(Team = short_name) %&gt;%\n  mutate(TeamHitPercent = (sum(kills) - sum(errors)) / sum(total_attacks)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(aps = assists / s) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nfirst_team &lt;- c(\"Rachel Fairbanks\",\"Kami Miner\", \"Kendra Wait\")\nsecond_team &lt;- c(\"Emma Grome\", \"Bergen Reilly\", \"Izzy Starck\")\nthird_team &lt;- c(\"Charlie Fuerbringer\", \"Mia Tuaniga\", \"Camryn Turner\", \"Argentina Ung\")\nall_americans &lt;- c(\"Rachel Fairbanks\",\"Kami Miner\", \"Kendra Wait\", \"Emma Grome\", \"Bergen Reilly\", \"Izzy Starck\",\"Charlie Fuerbringer\", \"Mia Tuaniga\", \"Camryn Turner\", \"Argentina Ung\")\n\nsetters &lt;- vb %&gt;%\n  filter(pos == \"S\") %&gt;%\n  filter(s &gt;= 72) %&gt;%\n  filter(aps &gt;= 2) %&gt;%\n  mutate(`All American` = \"NA\")\n\nft_setters &lt;- setters %&gt;%\n  filter(player %in% first_team) %&gt;%\n  mutate(`All American` = \"First-Team\")\n\nst_setters &lt;- setters %&gt;%\n  filter(player %in% second_team) %&gt;%\n  mutate(`All American` = \"Second-Team\")\n\ntt_setters &lt;- setters %&gt;% \n  filter(player %in% third_team) %&gt;%\n  mutate(`All American` = \"Third-Team\")\n\naa_setters &lt;- setters %&gt;%\n  filter(player %in% all_americans)\n\nbigten &lt;- setters %&gt;%\n  filter(conference==\"Big Ten\")\n\nbr &lt;- setters %&gt;%\n  filter(player == \"Bergen Reilly\")\n\n#mean(setters$s)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + geom_point(data = setters, aes(x=TeamHitPercent, y=aps)) + \n  geom_point(data = ft_setters, aes(x=`TeamHitPercent`, y=aps, color=`All American`)) + \n  geom_point(data = st_setters, aes(x=`TeamHitPercent`, y=aps, color=`All American`)) + \n  geom_point(data = tt_setters, aes(x=`TeamHitPercent`, y=aps, color=`All American`)) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Other\" = \"black\",\"First-Team\" = \"gold\",\"Second-Team\" = \"darkgrey\",\"Third-Team\"=\"#CD7F32\")) + \n  labs(title = \"Elite setters set themselves apart offensively\", subtitle = \"All-Americans consistently lead important performance metrics\", x=\"Team Hitting Percentage\", y=\"Assists Per Set\", caption=\"Source: ncaa_womens_volleyball_playerstats_2024.csv | By Dominic Sander\", fill=\"All Americans\") +\n  xlim(0, 0.35) + ylim(0,12) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA scatter plot of Team Hitting Percentage and Assists per Set gives a good idea of how Division one NCAA setters stack up against each other. As one would expect, the setters receiving All-American honors were at the top right of the graph indicating high efficiency in team hitting and in assists per set played. Not far behind are the second and Third-Teamers who rank ahead of almost all of their fellow setters. As fun as looking at all of these unnamed points is, breaking down stats by individual may help create a clearer picture on what helps All-Americans stand out.\nIn particular, I want to take a look at Bergen Reilly, the setter for the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Growing up in Lincoln, my grandpa would occasionally let me tag along to the Nebraska volleyball games he shot photos for. As you may expect, an early introduction to the sport made me a devoted fan. With this fandom comes some natural bias. Many Husker fans, myself included, had hoped to see Bergen on the First-Team list last season. The table below helps give us a better idea of where she stacks up against her fellow All-Americans.\n\n\nCode\naa_table &lt;- aa_setters %&gt;%\n  mutate(\"Blocks per Set\" = (block_solos + 0.5*block_assists)/s) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\"Kills per Set\" = kills / s) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\"Aces per Set\" = aces / s) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\"Digs per Set\" = digs / s) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\"Assists per Set\" = assists / s) %&gt;%\n  rename(\"Hitting Percentage\" = \"hit_pct\") %&gt;%\n  rename(\"Team Hitting Percentage\" = \"TeamHitPercent\") %&gt;%\n  rename(Player = player) %&gt;%\n  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~ round(., 3))\n\naa_table$`All American Team` &lt;- c(\"Second Team\",\"Second Team\",\"First Team\",\"First Team\",\"First Team\",\"Third Team\",\"Second Team\",\"Third Team\", \"Third Team\", \"Third Team\")\n\n\naa_table &lt;- aa_table[,c(6,2,34,17,41,37:40,42)]\n\naa_table %&gt;% \n  arrange(`All American Team`,-`Team Hitting Percentage`) %&gt;%\n  gt() %&gt;%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Team hitting percentage reigns supreme for All-American selection committee\",\n    subtitle = \"Reilly falls just short compared to the first-teamers, but shines elsewhere\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Team == \"Nebraska\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Dominic Sander  |  **Source:** ncaa_womens_volleyball_playerstats_2024.csv\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size = 12)\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size = 12)\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  opt_row_striping() %&gt;%\n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") %&gt;%\n  fmt_number(\n    columns = c(Team),\n    decimals = 0\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam hitting percentage reigns supreme for All-American selection committee\n\n\nReilly falls just short compared to the first-teamers, but shines elsewhere\n\n\nPlayer\nTeam\nTeam Hitting Percentage\nHitting Percentage\nAssists per Set\nBlocks per Set\nKills per Set\nAces per Set\nDigs per Set\nAll American Team\n\n\n\n\nRachel Fairbanks\nPittsburgh\n0.332\n0.354\n10.670\n0.220\n0.380\n0.380\n2.210\nFirst Team\n\n\nKendra Wait\nCreighton\n0.324\n0.398\n10.966\n0.470\n1.043\n0.197\n2.915\nFirst Team\n\n\nKami Miner\nStanford\n0.314\n0.348\n11.205\n0.357\n0.571\n0.205\n2.554\nFirst Team\n\n\nBergen Reilly\nNebraska\n0.284\n0.383\n11.082\n0.266\n0.664\n0.172\n2.852\nSecond Team\n\n\nIzzy Starck\nPenn St.\n0.283\n0.268\n10.985\n0.370\n0.830\n0.141\n2.533\nSecond Team\n\n\nEmma Grome\nKentucky\n0.271\n0.293\n11.300\n0.309\n0.345\n0.182\n2.264\nSecond Team\n\n\nCharlie Fuerbringer\nWisconsin\n0.286\n0.270\n10.948\n0.302\n0.543\n0.319\n2.500\nThird Team\n\n\nCamryn Turner\nKansas\n0.283\n0.312\n11.287\n0.338\n0.685\n0.130\n2.907\nThird Team\n\n\nArgentina Ung\nArizona St.\n0.272\n0.276\n10.189\n0.311\n1.099\n0.243\n2.622\nThird Team\n\n\nMia Tuaniga\nSouthern California\n0.238\n0.390\n10.000\n0.365\n0.713\n0.410\n2.041\nThird Team\n\n\n\nBy: Dominic Sander | Source: ncaa_womens_volleyball_playerstats_2024.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking exclusively at the Team Hitting Percentage column, First-Teamers clearly led the way. No other team hitting percentages came close to that of Pittsburgh, Creighton, and Stanford. It seems, then, that the committee making these All-American selections might weigh Team Hitting Percentage more than any other statistic. All three First-Team setters also had very efficient Personal Hitting Percentages, indicating it might be another tool used to find “the best of the best.”\nComparing Bergen Reilly to the other All-Americans, it is apparent that Nebraska’s hitting percentage was closer to that of Second and Third-Teamers. However, Reilly did really well in other categories. She was third in Personal Hitting Percentage, just 0.015 behind first. She also ranked fourth in Assists per Set and third in Digs per Set, helping her case to be considered one of the best.\nContinuing the focus on Reilly, let’s see how she fares within the Big Ten conference. After all, she did win Big Ten Setter of the Year. Was this justified, or did she get the benefit of the doubt given Nebraska’s position as a perennial national championship contender?\n\n\nCode\nbr &lt;- setters %&gt;%\n  filter(player == \"Bergen Reilly\")\np5conf &lt;- c(\"Big Ten\", \"ACC\", \"Big East\", \"SEC\", \"Big 12\")\np5set &lt;- setters %&gt;%\n  filter(conference %in% p5conf)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nplot1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=p5set, \n    aes(x=conference, y=aps), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=bigten, \n    aes(x=conference, y=aps), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=br,\n    aes(x=conference,y=aps), color=\"red\") + \n  labs(x=NULL, y=NULL, title = \"Assists per Set by Conference\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = br,\n    aes(x = conference, y = aps, label = player), color=\"red\",nudge_x=-0.24) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nplot2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=p5set, \n    aes(x=conference, y=TeamHitPercent), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=bigten, \n    aes(x=conference, y=TeamHitPercent), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=br,\n    aes(x=conference,y=TeamHitPercent), color=\"red\") + \n  labs(x=NULL, y=NULL, title = \"Team Hitting Percentage by Conference\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = br,\n    aes(x = conference, y = TeamHitPercent, label = player), color=\"red\",nudge_x=-0.1) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nplot3 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=p5set, \n    aes(x=conference, y=hit_pct), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=bigten, \n    aes(x=conference, y=hit_pct), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=br,\n    aes(x=conference,y=hit_pct), color=\"red\") + \n  labs(x=\"Conference\", y=NULL, title = \"Hitting Percentage by Conference\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = br,\n    aes(x = conference, y = hit_pct, label = player), color=\"red\", nudge_x=-0.1) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\nplot1 / plot2 / plot3 + plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Bergen Reilly dominates in the Big Ten\",\n    subtitle = \"She sits at or near the top in all important metrics\",\n    caption = \"Source: ncaa_womens_volleyball_players_2024.csv | By Dominic Sander\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the Big Ten, the stats certainly validate Reilly as Setter of the Year. She leads or ranks second in Assists per Set, Team Hitting Percentage, and Personal Hitting Percentage, arguably the three most important metrics when assessing setters’ performances.\nAfter taking a deeper dive into some statistics from the 2024 college volleyball season, we come to the conclusion that Team Hitting Percentage is key for a setter looking to become First-Team All-American. Doing well in Assists per Set and Personal Hitting Percentage also helps one’s case, but they don’t seem to carry as much weight. Obviously, we can’t say for certain how the selection committee views players, but it doesn’t hurt to look for patterns.\nAs for Bergen Reilly, I think the committee made the right decision placing her at Second-Team All-American. She is unquestionably a top setter in the country, however, Nebraska’s Team Hitting Percentage just fell too far behind Pittsburgh, Stanford, and Creighton. Given that Nebraska leads the nation in Team Hitting Percentage in 2025 though, it would be shocking to see her anywhere other than at the very top this year."
